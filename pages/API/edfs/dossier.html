All the embedded files are reflected by records in blockchain (called assets).

The control on the blockchain records is guarded by blockchain transactions

Embedded Web Applications are implemented without any servers (service workers)

    In a sense a CSB is a sidechain but not a usual one. A CSB it is not a permanently online blockchain (Sidechain). We
    call it as an offline Sidechain.
    It is a new breed of blockchain: offline blockchains. There are no online P2P nodes communicating between them all
    the time. We have only an “Indirect communication” by anchoring the new HASH of
    the BAR (A CSB is a BAR) in a blockchain and by adding new Bricks in the cloud storages.

    From the programmer perspective CSBs are self-refreshing archives that can be read or updated only in those nodes
    with access to the SEED (encryption key).
    The archive is containing a chained history of events (like in an event sourcing implemented as a blockchain) that
    at each self-refreshing moment are used
    for automated verification of the security and business rules.
    The verification and consensus happens “offline” like in “when needed to read or write” and all the history of
    events (even invalid ones) remain stored as Bricks.
    If a node is writing wrong transactions, they will be ignored by the network.

    The consensus at the level of a CSB depends heavily on the consensus happening properly in the blockchain in which
    the CSB is anchored in. We can call it “anchored consensus”.
