    <psk-chapter title="Introduction">
        The purpose of the KeySSI concept is to provide blockchain-anchored identities for things and processes, 
        but potentially also for companies and individuals. 
        The concept of KeySSI is more general than the concept proposed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C DID web standard</a>. 
        DIDs and KeySSIs are two different methods of creating SSIs (Self Sovereign Identifiers).<br/>
        Also, an important innovation proposed by KeySSI is that they are used as secret (symmetrical) encryption/decryption keys for DSUs (or for parts of the DSUs).<br/>
        A KeySSI never comes alone but is accompanied by KeySSIs derived from it or from which it was derived. Derivation can be understood as a form of access delegation:
        someone who holds a KeySSI with a higher access level delegates accesses to lower levels.

    <psk-chapter title="Key SSI syntax">
        The syntax of KeySSIs is inspired by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C DID</a>, but the KeySSI starts with the “ssi” string and the DID
        methods are interpreted as subtypes and not as incompatible methods.

            <code>subtype</code> is a string representing the KeySSI's type.
            <code>Ledger.domain/path</code> represents a path in a blockchain hierarchy.
            <code>Subtype specific</code> is usually a Zero Access SSI (zaSSI).
            <code>Control</code> is used by the anchoring services to validate the requests for a new version of the anchored DSU. The algorithm used for verification is subtype specific.
            <code>vn</code> is a string reflecting the version number of the subtype. The <code>vn</code> field is optional and, if missing, is set to <code>v0</code>.  Each version establishes the hash function and algorithm used by the control mechanisms.
            <code>Hint</code>  is optional and subtype specific. Typically provides some additional information to the KeySSI resolver.

        <psk-chapter title="SecretSSIs subtypes family (Self certifying SSIs)">
            The most important subtypes of KeySSI are self certifying SSIs. The self certification properties are coming
            from the usage of the hash of a public key as part of the identifier. The image below shows shows the main
            types
            of self certifying KeySSIs and the access level each type provides.
            <psk-img src="/assets/images/edfs/self_certifying_keyssis.png" title="Self certifying KeySSIs"></psk-img>
            <psk-highlight type-of-highlight="note" title="Note">
                The downward arrow in the image above represents the <code>derivation</code> operation; the
                lower level KeySSIs are derived from higher level KeySSIs. A lower level KeySSI is, usually, obtained
                by applying a cryptographic hash function to a higher level KeySSI. The above KeySSI hierarchy is called
                the <code>SecretSSI family</code>.
            </psk-highlight>
            <psk-highlight type-of-highlight="example" title="Self certifying KeySSIs' generation">
                SecretSSI := random():hpk <br>
                AnchorSSI := hash(SeedSSI):hpk <br>
                ReadSSI := hash(AnchorSSI):hpk<br>
                PublicSSI := hash(ReadSSI):hpk<br>
                zaSSI := hash(PublicSSI):hpk
            </psk-highlight>
            In the example above:
            <psk-list type="unordered">
                <code>random</code> is a cryptographically safe random generating function
                <code>hash</code> is a cryptographic hashing function
                <code>hpk</code> is the hash of the public key
            </psk-list>
            As seen in the above example, the SecretSSI family is created starting from a random secret number (256bits) in
            the subtype specific part of the
            identifier and the hash of a public key in the control part. All the other subtypes are derived using a hash
            function from the subtype specific part of the previous subtype
            (<psk-link chapter="SecretSSIs subtypes family (Self certifying SSIs)">see the above image</psk-link>).
            The blockchain's state and the public key's hash are preserved during subtype derivation.

        <psk-chapter title="Seed based subtypes family">
            Seed based KeySSI's are not self-certifying (do not contain a reference to the public key in their identifiers).
            The image and table below show the Seed based KeySSI family and the purposes of each KeySSI:

            <psk-table header="true">
                KeySSI type | Purpose
                secret | Owning a SecretSSI provides total control (ownership) over the anchored DSU <br/> Example: <br/>ssi:secret:domain:secret_key_base58:hash_public_key_base58:v0
                anchor | Owning an AnchorSSI provides anchoring (write access). The possession of the SecretSSI is required for anchoring new versions of the DSU. An AnchorSSI  provides read access to the confidential information from the DSU and to the secret part of the DSU (as will be defined in the next chapter).The confidential and the secret part are not identical (despite some potential confusion from the name) <br/> Example: <br/> ssi:anchor:domain:hash(SecretSSI):hash_public_key_base58:v0
                read | Owning a SecretSSI provides read access to the confidential part of the DSU. Depending on the DSU type, typically here confidential part contains business-specific information that is shared to a larger group.<br/>Example:<br/>ssi:read:domain:hash(AnchorSSI):hash_public_key_base58:v0
                public | Owning a SecretSSI provides read access to the public part of the DSU. The public and confidential parts are not the same, the public contains public keys or other types of information that are not confidential in any important way.<br/>Example: <br/>ssi:public:domain:hash(ReadSSI):hash_public_key_base58:v0
                za | Owning a zaSSI provides no access. Having a zaSSI indicates that a SecretSSI exists and has a specified number of versions<br/>Example: <br/>ssi:zar:domain:hash(PublicSSI):hash_public_key_base58:v0
