    Interoperability and data portability between wallets is achieved by storing the data and code in DSUs. The wallets
    themself and the different plugins/components of the wallets (the SSapps) could run in all OpenDSU compatible
    wallets because the agent loading the DSU for the wallet is a web browser. The Web Browser can use Service Workers
    and other sandboxing mechanisms (iframes, workers) to execute the code and to display the interface that is coded
    inside of the DSUs. The use of the Service Workers (SW) is aimed to replace the need for any )servers. Using service
    works it is possible to store data in DSUs and to offer data from DSUs, including the HTML files and JavaScript used
    by the user interfaces.<br/>
    Created using web technologies, the concepts of DSUs and Self Sovereign Applications (SSApps) are offering a perfect
    solution to achieve the interoperability and data portability between OpenDSU compatible wallets.
