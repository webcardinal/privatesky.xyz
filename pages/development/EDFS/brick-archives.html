    <psk-chapter title="Introduction">
        <p>In order to overcome some of the limitations (such as the inability to stream) of the
            existent archiving protocols (such as zip), PrivateSky created its own archiving protocol, BAR (Brick
            Archive). In short, the BAR protocol breaks files into blocks of equal length called “bricks”, and keeps
            references to all the bricks in a separate file called “bar map”. Optionally, the protocol allows the
            compression and/or encryption of the “bricks”.
        </p>
    </psk-chapter>
    <psk-chapter title="Archiving process">
        <p>
            As mentioned above, the archiving mechanism that BAR protocol employs relies on breaking files into “bricks”
            and keeping references to these bricks in an additional brick called bar map. The bar map also keeps the
            order of the bricks in the original file and, in the case in which the archive is encrypted, the bar map
            keeps the encryption key for each brick. When encryption is employed, each brick is individually encrypted
            with its own cryptographic key in order to prevent compromising the entire archive if a brick’s key is
            compromised (that will be the case if all bricks in the archive would be encrypted using the same
            cryptographic key). Figure 1 illustrates the bar map’s format.
        </p>
        <psk-img title="Figure 1 - Bar Map's structure" src="/assets/images/newlook/BarMap.svg"></psk-img>
        <p>
            In the figure above:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>filepath_i, i = 1, m represents the file’ s path inside the BAR archive; the path separator inside an
                archive is “/”.
            </li>
            <li>{ hash_ij: key_ij }, i=1, m, j=1, nl are the hash of brick j and the cryptographic key used to encrypt
                brick j of file i; nl is the number of bricks in file i.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As seen above, the pairs <i>{ hash: key }</i> are stored inside an array to preserve the order of bricks
            inside a
            file;
            knowing the order of bricks inside a file is paramount for reconstructing said file from its component
            bricks at
            extraction. Data inside the bar map are, also, kept inside a brick. The reference to this brick and the
            cryptographic key used for its encryption (if the archive is encrypted) are returned at the end of the
            archiving
            process. The bar map brick’s reference and cryptographic key are the only data one needs in order to decrypt
            and
            extract all the files inside the archive.
        </p>
    </psk-chapter>
    <psk-chapter title="Extraction">
        <p>
            Extraction of files from a BAR means reconstructing the files inside the archive from its bricks. As the bar
            map contains the references to all bricks of each file, as well as the keys used for bricks’ encryption, in
            order to extract files from an archive one needs only the reference of the brick that stores the bar map and
            the key used for its encryption ( if it is the case ). After reading the data from bar map, the rest of the
            extraction process is pretty straightforward, as bricks’ hashes and keys for each file inside the archive
            are kept in bar map.
        </p>

    <psk-chapter title="BAR library">
        <p>
            At an abstract level, the BAR library takes files from some file system which are then transferred in a
            brick storage and, conversely, takes archives from a brick storage and extracts them in some file system. To
            this extent, the BAR library is configurable such that both the file system from which the files that are
            added to the archive (FsAdapter) and the brick storage can be specified.
            The BAR library exposes the methods the <i>Archive</i> class. An instance of the <i>Archive</i> class takes
            as argument an
            instance of the <i>ArchiveConfigurator</i> class; the <i>ArchiveConfigurator</i> instance contains the brick
            storage, the
            file system that stores the files added to the archive, the brick size in bytes. Below are described the
            <i>Archive</i> and <i>ArchiveConfigurator</i> classes.

                <i>ArchiveConfigurator</i> is the class through which the instances of the <i>Archive</i> class are
                configured. It
                allows to specify the file system that stores the files added to the archive, the brick storage, the
                brick size and the type of encryption and/or compression used, through the following interface:
