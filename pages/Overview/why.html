    <psk-chapter title="Why">
        The open source PrivateSky platform is built and maintained by a research community formed with people from industry and  university researchers.
        We are passionate and dedicated to the idea of improving programming in general and cloud programming in particular.
        We have a strong focus on security and data protection using cryptographic protocols and software architectures based on swarm communication.
        PrivateSky is the result of a type of research that neither big companies, startups nor universities can easily do.
        On the one hand  companies and startups have budgetary constraints and  internal organizational complexity that typically prevents the existence of a sufficient number of
        iterations (many partial failures and endurance to swim against the current technological fashion for decades).
        Our team has worked hard to explore the concept of swarm communication and choreography for almost 10 years.
        We were lucky, because  universities typicaly do not have programmers and architects with enough industry experience to explore such practical directions.
        While many groups are trying to create alternatives to Object Oriented Programming we took the harder way of trying to improve its core.
        We have not finished our work, we are continuing our efforts to simplify, apply  and present the swarm communication concept in new and better ways.
        PrivateSky is a good exercise but we are confident because  the core idea of swarm communications enabled powerful results.
        Selling new thinking methods is harder than we would have expected 10 years ago. However, we will keep pushing these ideas because they will bring strong practical results for the whole industry.

    <psk-chapter  title="How">
        <p>PrivateSky is a direct collaboration between programmers and architects with 10-20 years experience in industry and researchers from the university.
            This effort led us to a series of significant results that promise to improve  object-oriented programming.
            Our approach does not try to propose radical paradigm shifts, as we believe that imperative programming and object-oriented programming are rather worth to be improved and not replaced.
        </p>

        <p>Although we recognize the value of functional programming or type-oriented programming (eg Haskel), a refusal to look for ways to improve OOP and imperative programming seems
            wrong. In this sense, the central point of our research is to replace the metaphor of "objects" with "processes" and not with pure functions, monads or other
            new complex abstractions. Semantically and syntactically the objects and classes are good enough, we try to add semantic improvements and on the level of pragmatics.</p>

        <p>In the years since we worked on SwarmESB and PrivateSky projects, we have iterated new ideas that sometimes went away from current fashion and why it was considered "best practice".
            Changing your point of view and habits is difficult and only in retrospect can you see how obvious some ideas are. We are trying to guess which direction should be developed in relation
            to the current state of programming science. Although we were often disappointed with object-oriented programming (OOP), we have long looked at ways to reuse the huge experience
            of this programming model. We don't think the industry needs programming languages ​​or frameworks that can only be used by geniuses who have been studying complex mathematical concepts for years.
            Rather, we believe that we should have tools that offered the possibility to program as close to the essential complexity of the problem (the tools should not add artificial complexity). </p>

    <psk-chapter  title="Innovations">
        It happened that our research and development effort leaded us to build the PrivateSky programming platform.
        PrivateSky offer new approaches for building  Blockchain Platform, MicroServices based cloud backends, Complex Integration Projects, Composition of services using Executable Choreographies.
        In the blockchain area we propose the concept of Hierahical Blockchain Domains, Self Sovereign Applications to improve the DApps concept.
        To see all our results, please check our page <psk-link page="overview/main innovations" >Presenting PrivateSky Innovations</psk-link>.
