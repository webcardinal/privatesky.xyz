  <psk-chapter title="Hierarchical Blockchain Domains">
    <psk-chapter title="Heterogeneous Blockchain Domains">
      PrivateSky introduced the concept of Blockchain Domain.
      A Blockchain Domain is a blockchain network that is part in a hierarchy of blockchain domains. In the root of the hierarchy stays a "root domain".
      Any domains can have one parent or multiple parent domains. Periodically, each child should anchor its state in the parent domains.
      The benefits are  obvious as this can solve scalability, confidentiality issues while also allowing updated in the form of creation of new blockchain domains.

    </psk-chapter>

    <psk-chapter title="Anchoring. Off-chain Storage Called EDFS">
     An important insight resulted from the PrivateSky related research is that from teh confidentiality point of view it is almost always a bad idea to have business logic onchain (in smart contracts).
      There are cases where having network level visible smart contracts makes sense (for example in  the network governance components)  but
      usually only a small of group of participants should see the data or the evolution of te business process.
      Encryption or pseudonymisation are not very useful  because correlation with external events are always source of confidentiality leakages.
      We have build a powerful approach to this problem in teh form of the offchain storage we call EDFS (Encrypted Distributed File System).
      EDFS is formed from  data storage units that are by like tiny file systems capable to store data and some processing code. Let's call these data units with the generic name "Data Sharing Units".
      The DSU are anchored in blockchain as a method fo obtaining integrity, lineage and verifiability.
      The DSUs are also capable of referencing other DSUs, therefore a decentralised file system is formed.

      <psk-img src="/assets/images/architecture/offchainArchitecture.png" title="Data Sharing Units and Anchoring"></psk-img>

      In PrivateSky we have developed support for three types of DSUs: BARs and Wallets.

    </psk-chapter>

    <psk-chapter title="Anchored Offline Blockchains ">
    A special case of the Off-Chain storage is when the DSUs are basicaly small off-chain ledgers  that are shared between a group.
    The verification of the ledger is done when there is a need to read or update the ledger.
    Any changes requires blockchain anchoring and therefore the anchored ledger have the integrity, lineage and verifiability properties of a blockchain.
    We call this type of ledger with the name "DSU". A DSU could contain a ledger (a blockchain like data structure) but also could contain UI code (web application).
    A DSU that embeds a web application that works only with the data from the DSU is  named Self Sovereign Application.

    <psk-description>
      PrivateSky perspective for a typical blockchain architecture is summarized in the above picture. We have identified 5 layers in the architecture as will be described below. We see the architecture layers as types of concerns that are reflected in the system quality attributes.
    </psk-description>
    <psk-chapter title="Networking Layer">

      This layer is focused on setting the rules and communication capabilities of the physical nodes doing network communication. For public blockchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum) this layer contains the concerns of P2P communication, node booting, etc. For permissioned DLTs, it reflects concerns regarding restricting access while allowing communication to the entities that have permission. For permissioned DLTs this layer could imply the need to configure VPNs, SDNs, Certificate Authorities, etc.

    </psk-chapter>


    <psk-chapter title = "Blockchain Logical View">

      This layer contains one or multiple blockchain domains. Each blockchain domain could use a different version of the software (a fork) or even different technology entirely. Not all members should replicate all domains (for privacy this is actually a requirement). A special blockchain domain is the Blockchain Root as in PrivateSky we propose that any non-root blockchain to be anchored in the Blockchain Root to benefit from the security offered by the fact that the root domain is replicated by all participants (the whole consortium).
      This layer is a logical layer, it does not exist as actual nodes but at a conceptual level (for example a shared ledger it is consistent at the logical level because at each moment each physical node will have a slightly different state)

    </psk-chapter>


    <psk-chapter title="Physical Blockchain Replicas and Storages">
      At this layer, we have actual blockchain software running. The software at this level can be the type of blockchain nodes that participate in the consensus, blockchain nodes that are used for caching (do not participate in the consensus but serve the consumers at the top level) and the software that provides the data storage services.  The storage services are storing (typically encrypted) data that is directly anchored in blockchains. In PrivateSky we call these storages near-chains as they are special types of encrypted blockchains to which access is shared only with a limited group of users.
      The code belonging to this layer will run in a containerized environment that typically should stay outside the company firewalls (in the DMZ area) as the communication should be performed with similar nodes from other organisations.

    </psk-chapter>

    <psk-chapter title="Containerised APIs">
      In this layer of architecture, we have positioned the containers that offer services (typically REST services) to the applications that implement useful use-cases. By containers we mean Linux containers (eg docker). This layer is executed in a trusted environment, typically each company or participant should run its separate copy. The blockchain governance software should be executed at this level.  Containers could be executed in DMZ but access to the services offered will typically be restricted to the company's internal network.
    </psk-chapter>


    <psk-chapter title="Far-Chain: Blockchain Applications">
      In this layer of architecture are all the applications and systems that use data extracted from the blockchains but are not directly connected to the blockchain. This layer is connected with blockchain through the Containerised APIs. This layer is called far-chain because it is the most logical and physically distant from blockchains. Typically, all the code from this layer is a regular enterprise code that uses APIs as a source or destination of the manipulated data and ideally is not concerned about the strictness introduced by blockchains. This layer is executed in a trusted environment and its human users should trust this environment.
